# SwitchExtractorTool

SwitchExtractorTool allows you to extract dumped Nintendo Switch games so you can datamine them. 

It lets you extract:

-XCIs

-NSPs

-NCAs (both encrypted [from nsp] and unencrypted [from xci])

Keys.dat are illegal files so they are not shared with this program as you will have to provide them yourself.
However the functioning version of hactool is available as the latest one seems to be buggy.
